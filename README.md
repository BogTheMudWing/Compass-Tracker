# Compass-Tracker
A data pack that allows any number of hunters to track any number of runners in all three dimensions.

- Use `/team join Runner` to become a runner.
- Use `/function manhunt:start` to give all other players compasses.

Each individual compass is updated by holding it. It will point to the nearest runner. It will spin without direction if there are no runners in your dimension.
