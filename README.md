# Compass-Tracker
A data pack that allows any number of hunters to track any number of runners in all three dimensions.

- Use `/team join Runner` to become a runner.
- Use `/function manhunt:start` to give all other players compasses.
- Use `/trigger manhunt-options` to open the settings menu.

Each individual compass is updated by holding it. It will point to the nearest runner. It will not update if there are no runners in your dimension.

## Features
### Multi-runner
Compass Tracker supports any number of hunters and any number of survivors. Each hunter tracks the runner closest to them.
### Multi-life
Runners can be given a configurable number of lives before being set to spectator mode after losing their last life.
### Auto-compass
The Tracker Compass updates automatically while held and provides feedback (configurable) if there is a runner to track. The compass remains locked on its last target.
### Anti-abuse Endgame
Enable Cornucopia Endgame to keep multiple runners from separating. All living runners must enter the end to damage the dragon. Upon reaching the end, runners will be reduced to one life and the end portal will become trackable by the Tracker Compass.
